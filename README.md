# HotelRoomBooking
This was created for CS1073 Introduction to Java class.
This is a JavaFX based GUI application that allows guests to book rooms based on following rules: 
Guests can book either a Suite or Standard room.To book a room the guest making the booking must provide their name, the
number of nights, the number of guests (total) staying in the room, and the
number of beds (total) required. 
Suites have two double beds plus a pull-out couch included in the base price, but each additional bed has a cost of $15/night. Suites have a base nightly rate of $380 which includes a complimentary breakfast for all guests. The check-out time for Suites is 12 noon.
When booking a suite, guests will receive a free perk. The perk is determined randomly at the time the booking is made and will be either a bottle of
champagne, box of chocolates, or fruit basket. Standard rooms have two double beds included and each additional bed has a cost of $20/night.
Standard rooms have a base nightly rate of $225 and each guest is charged $9.75/night for breakfast. The check-out time for Standard rooms is either 10am
or 11am; this is determined randomly at the time the booking is made.
